# CH10-Azure Coding Events Deployment Script
With my preferment for automation, I decided to take the challenge of fully automating the CH10 Studio walkthrough. 
Concepts Practiced:
- Configuring IIS-SITE through CLI
- Configuring VM and obtaining information through AZ CLI
- Automatically provisioning appsettings

Overview: 
- Once deploying the main script .\DeploymentScript. It will run dependant on azure cli and 3 subscripts specified in the deployment script
- Further details provided within each script
